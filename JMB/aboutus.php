                Hello I'm Jonas, and the CEO and co founder of JMB. I manage our small team of three, and have the bigger overview. I noticed that electronics are extremly overpriced in Denmark aswell as a big part of Europe. Which is why I thought of starting this company with my two great old friends. Therefore bringing quality electronics at a much cheaper price, to help your daily routines.

            Hello I'm Morten, and I'm the head of the IT department. I got contacted by Jonas who had this brilliant idea, and I was hooked. Since I already have a lot of knowledge within web development, I was the obvious choise for handling all the Internet Technology.
